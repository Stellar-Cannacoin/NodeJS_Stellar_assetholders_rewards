This is a simple Node.js application that allows you to fetch the holders of a Stellar asset and initiate payouts to them. You can use this tool to reward the asset holders of your choice by modifying the configuration in the .env file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
3. Install the project dependencies:

### Configuration
Before you can use the application, you need to configure it by modifying the .env file. The .env file should have the following structure:

```

PAYOUT_ISSUER="PAYOUT_ASSET_ISSUER"

```

- **CODE:** Replace with the code of the Stellar asset you want to distribute rewards for.
- **ISSUER:** Replace with the public key of the asset issuer.
- **PAYOUT_CODE:** Replace with the code of the Stellar asset you want to distribute rewards **in.**
- **PAYOUT_ISSUER:** Replace with the public key of the asset issuer you want to distrubyte rewards **in.**

Make sure you have the necessary Lumens (XLM) in the account associated with the PUBLIC and SECRET keys to cover transaction fees.
